## Overview

This Python project leverages NLP techniques to create a sentiment analysis classifier for customer reviews on Amazon. The classifier utilizes the VADER sentiment analysis tool and Hugging Face's RoBERTa transformers from NLTK, aiming to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content.

## Features

- **VADER Sentiment Analysis:** The project integrates the VADER sentiment analysis tool, known for its ability to handle sentiment analysis of text in a context-aware manner.

- **Hugging Face's RoBERTa Transformers:** State-of-the-art RoBERTa transformers from Hugging Face are employed to enhance the model's performance in understanding and classifying sentiment in natural language.

- **Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset:** A sample dataset of Amazon customer reviews is included for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
